# When Fetched Over Axios with some Tailwind Styling

This is a blog site set up in part to

- demonstrate using Fetch API for making HTTP requests
- using Tailwind for layout responsiveness and typography

<hr>

I ordinarily default to Axios for HTTP Requests even though the fetch() API is capable of reproducing the key features
of Axios, and also available browsers today.

Anyway, here goes

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```
